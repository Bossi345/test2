# Week 1 Practice Problems


These problems assume that you have already set up your CS50 Codespace in [Lab 1](../Lab_1.md). Be sure to complete that before attempting these problems.


In addition to this week’s lab and problem set, you’re welcome to try any of these (optional!) practice problems:


* [Debug](debug.md), for becoming familiar with C syntax and debugging programs
* [Half](half.md), for practice creating a function
* [Prime](prime.md), for practice using `for` loops
