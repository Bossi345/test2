# Week 3 Practice Problems


In addition to this week’s lab and problem set, you’re welcome to try any of these (optional!) practice problems:


* [Recursive `atoi`](atoi.md), for practice creating recursive functions
* [Average Temperatures](temps.md), for practice working with `struct`s and sorting algorithms
* [Max](max.md), for practice passing arrays to functions and finding maximum values
* [Snackbar](snackbar.md), for practice using `struct`s and writing a linear search algorithm
